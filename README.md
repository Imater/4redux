## install and development
To start developing, run:
```bash
npm run install
npm run dev
```
and open the displayed link in the browser.

You can use [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) to install dependencies. Yarn is several times faster than npm.
```bash
yarn install
```

For fast development and error handling, use render only on client:
```bash
npm run dev-render-on-client
```

Karma testing with watch:
```bash
npm run test
```

Open storybook on http://localhost:9001/ after starting:
```bash
npm run storybook
```
